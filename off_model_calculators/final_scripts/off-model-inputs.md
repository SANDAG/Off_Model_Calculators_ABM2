# Off Model Calculator Work Flow
This document describes the work flow required to run each of the off model 
calculators prepared by SANDAG's TDM and planning staff.

Each of these off model calculators will need to be run for every 2035 build 
scenario. (The sheet names will need to be updated, since each sheet can only hold
a single scenario for each model year.) There are 7 off model calculators:
* Bikeshare
* Carshare
* Community Based Transportation Programs (CBTP)
* Electric Vehicles
*	Microtransit
* Pooled Rides
* Vanpool
	* SANDAG ABM Transit Mode Share (binomial logit substitute)

	* Total population
	* MSA_ID
	* Bikeshare flag
* Emission Factors
	* Use of 2014 EMFAC Values from 14.0.0
	* 2050 EMFAC values if any data is to be generated

	* MSA_ID
	* Carshare flag
	* University flag
	* Military base flag
* Emission Factors
	* Use of 2014 EMFAC Values from 14.0.0
	* 2050 EMFAC values if any data is to be generated

# CBTP
