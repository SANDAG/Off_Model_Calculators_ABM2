# Off Model Calculator Work Flow
This document describes the work flow required to run each of the off model 
calculators prepared by SANDAG's TDM and planning staff.

Each of these off model calculators will need to be run for every 2035 [and 2050] build 
scenario. (The sheet names will need to be updated, since each sheet can only hold
a single scenario for each model year.) 

[Why only for 2035; don't they need to be run for all the scenario years?]

There are 7 off model calculators:
* Bikeshare
* Carshare
* Community Based Transportation Programs (CBTP)
* Electric Vehicles
*	Microtransit
* Pooled Rides
* Vanpool
	* SANDAG ABM Transit Mode Share (binomial logit substitute)  -- why is it singled out?  It's part of micro-transit

# Bikeshare
This sheet will require the confirmation of the following values from SANDAG 
planning staff:
* Main Sheet
	* Average bike trip distances (for regular bikes and ebikes) -- keep current assumption or replace with a value derived from ABM outputs? [We had internal discussion on this before at SANDAG and made decision to use the current assumption]
	* Confirmation of 50% ebike mode share
* Bikeway Miles
	* Bikeway miles estimate (by year, scenario and MSA)
* Model Data (by year, scenario and mgra)
	* Total population
* Emission Factors (by year, scenario)
	* Confirm use of 2014 EMFAC or 2017 EMFAC values from ABM 14.0.0
	* 2050 EMFAC values if any data is to be generated

# Carshare
This sheet will require the confirmation of the following values from SANDAG
planning staff:
* Model Data (by year, scenario, and mgra)
	* Total population
	* Adult population
	* Total population density (MGRA population / MGRA total area)
	* Total employment
	* College student enrollment
	* MSA
	* Carshare_flag
	* Univ_flag
	* MLB_flag
* Carshare Demand (by year, scenario, and MSA)
        * pop_urban (assuming population density > 17)
	* pop_suburban (assuming population density <= 17)
* Emission Factors
	* Confirm use of 2014 EMFAC or 2017 EMFAC values from ABM 14.0.0
	* 2050 EMFAC values if any data is to be generated

# CBTP
This sheet will require the confirmation of the following values from SANDAG 
planning staff:

* Main Sheet
	* Average daily one-way driving trips per household
	* Average number of years for which behavior change persists
	* Average one-way trip length for driving trips
* Community-Based Coverage Areas [only total households is used, delete the unused information]
	* Use of Community-Based Coverage Areas and Regional Growth Forecast (14.1.1)
* [Model Data (by year, scenario and mgra)
	* Total population] [as the disaggregate pop is unnecessary. suggest to use regional total pop directly]
* Emission Factors
	* Confirm use of 2014 EMFAC or 2017 EMFAC values from ABM 14.0.0
	* 2050 EMFAC values if any data is to be generated
	
# Electric Vehicles
Have not reviewed draft.

# Microtransit
!Need to add mode choice logic from excel sheet into R script!
This sheet will require the confirmation of the following values from SANDAG 
planning staff:

* Main Sheet
	* Average distance of auto trips 2 miles long or shorter, urban core market (by year)
	* Value of time definition [though it seems they really prefer to use the median income, so we should just update it; the calculator is currently using the mean income]
* Model Data NEV Shuttle (by year, orig_msa, dest_msa, orig_nevshuttle_flag, dest_nevshuttle_flag)       
	* person_trips
	* auto_trips    	
	These are generated by "SANDAG_MicrotransitCalculatorTables.R"
* Model Data CB Shuttle (by orig_msa, dest_msa, year; This one comes from ABMTransitModeShare.xlsx)
        ("SANDAG_TAP_TAP_to_MAZ_MAZ_IVT_OVT.R" is used to feed ABMTransitModeShare.xlsx)
	* Home to Work Person Trips to Employment Centers
	* Home to Work Drive Alone Trips to Employment Centers											
	* Home to Work Drive Alone Trips to Employment Centers, with no or poor fixed-route transit service											
	* Commuter Shuttle Trips, Unsubsidized											
	* Average Trip Distance, Full Fare 											
* Model Data (by year, scenario and mgra)
	* Total Employment
	* Total population
* Emission Factors
	* Confirm use of 2014 EMFAC or 2017 EMFAC values from ABM 14.0.0
	* 2050 EMFAC values if any data is to be generated


# Pooled Rides â€“ For each scenario year:
This sheet will require the confirmation of the following values from SANDAG 
planning staff:

* Main Sheet
	* Pooled Ride ASCs (work, nonwork; 0, 1, 2 cars), )  -- The ASCs will come from me, but we need SANDAG to review and ok them
	* Pooling Demand Subsidy for work trips 
	* Trips (by year, origin msa, destination msa, period, mode, purpose, number of autos) : This is generated by 
	"SANDAG_PooledrideCalculatorTables.R" script
* Model Skims Data (by year, origin msa, destination msa, period)
	* avg_datime	
	* avg_srtime	
	* avg_distance
	These are generated by "SANDAG_PooledrideCalculatorTables.R" script
* Population and Employment (by year and mgra)
	* Total employment
	* Total population
* Emission Factors
	* Confirm use of 2014 EMFAC or 2017 EMFAC values from ABM 14.0.0
	* 2050 EMFAC values if any data is to be generated

# Vanpool
This sheet will require the confirmation of the following values from SANDAG 
planning staff:

* Main Sheet
	* Assumed vanpool growth rate due to a subsidy increase (by year, van type)  -- No, SANDAG already decided on no additional lease cost subsidy beyond the current one ($400)
* Vanpool Demand FOR ML (Non-Mil), ML (mil)
	* Average one-way weekday travel time (2016) 
	* Average travel time savings (by origin msa, destination msa, by year)
	These two files are produced by "SANDAG_TravelTimeSaving.R" script for both military and non-military
